# Freesound API Key Guide

This guide outlines the steps to obtain an API key for Freesound.org, which is necessary for interacting with the Freesound API.

## Steps to Obtain an API Key:

1.  **Log in to your Freesound account:**
    Ensure you have an active account and are logged in on the Freesound.org website.

2.  **Navigate to the API Key Management Page:**
    Directly access the API key management page using the following URL:
    [https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply](https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply)

3.  **Manage or Apply for a New API Key:**
    On this page, you will be able to:
    *   View and manage any existing API keys you have.
    *   Apply for a new API key if you don't have one or need a new set of credentials. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the application process.

    Upon successful application, you will typically receive a `client_id` and a `client_secret`. The `client_id` (also sometimes referred to as the API key) is used for authentication. If the application requires a "Personal API Token" for direct `Token` authentication, you might need to look for that option in your Freesound account settings under API or developer section.
